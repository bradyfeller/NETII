# NETII
This is my final project for my .NET II class. It's a basic restaurant ordering system that's coded in C#, and demonstrates the use of basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality; using stored procedures to make calls to the database.

A few things to know:
  1. Be sure to run the batch file before attempting to use the program.
  2. There a few different users with varying roles that allow you to be able to view different tabs.
  3. There a quite a few things I'd like to change within this program, such as the layout of the tabs; giving a workflow to the user I'd      also like to use Data Binding, and implement interfaces.
  4. I intend to make a web front-end for this project, which should be available by Summer 2018.
  
Enjoy!
